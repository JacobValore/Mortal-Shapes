# Mortal Shapes

This is an original game, invented by me and a couple of my friends. It was loosely created as a 3 player variant of One Night Werewolf. In this game, you know the role of the other two players, but not your own role. Through deception and persuasive ability, you must figure out your allegiance and who you want to kill (or whether you want to abstain from killing). If two players target the third, the target dies, along with anyone on the same team. If two players abstain from targeting and the third player targets someone, the target dies, along with anyone on the same team. In all other scenarios, nobody dies.

There are two main teams, the Pyramids (red) and the Cubes (blue). If every player is on the same team then everyone's goal is to not target anyone so that nobody on their team dies. If there are both Pyramids and Cubes in a game, then your goal is to target a player of the opposite team. If a person on the opposite team dies, your team wins!

There is a neutral character, the Torus. If a Torus is in the game, then it doesn't matter who the other two characters are or who they target. The Torus' goal is to target nobody. If the Torus targets another player, the Torus and their target both lose. If the Torus targets nobody, the Torus wins! (and everyone else loses) *NOTE: The Torus has the power to cancel even Mystic characters. If a Torus is in the game, the win condition completely changes.*

Finally, there may be one Mystic Pyramid and/or one Mystic Cube in the game. If there is ONE Mystic in the game (of either team) then the allegiances of the other players swap. *BIG NOTE: This means if there were two Pyramids and one Mystic Cube in a game, then ALL THREE players are now on the CUBE team.* If there are TWO Mystics in the game, then the allegiance of the third player stays the same.

On the website you cannot choose what roles are included in the game, but it is recommended to start with just basic roles, then add in the torus, and add the mystics in last.
